# space-invaders
A C++ Space Invaders clone based on a tutorial by @educ8s. The base code was written as part of the tutorial, I didn't just clone/fork the repo. It should be verifiable by the differences in class names, spacings and so on.  ðŸ˜„

## Additonal features implemented by me:
1. Start menu with keybindings and skip to random boss (press 1)
2. Pause button & pause music button
3. "Game Over" screen with score
4. Game states
5. Separate UI class
6. Levels and infinite play
7. Boss battles every third level
8. Two different bosses - beat them for bonus lives!
9. Rising difficulty (max. reached after 10 levels)

## Possible future features:
1. More bosses
2. Power ups 
3. Ship upgrades between levels
4. Different player ship designs
5. More sounds

## How to compile:
1. Use VSCode
2. Clone repo
3. Install raylib (https://www.raylib.com/) to default path 
3. Start the main.code-workspace file
4. Press F5

You are on your own if you use another editor/IDE.
