# space-invaders
A C++ Space Invaders clone based on a tutorial by @educ8s. The base code was written as part of the tutorial, I didn't just clone/fork the repo. It should be verifiable by the differences in class names, spacings and so on.  ðŸ˜„

2. Pause button

5. Rising difficulty
6. Starting screen tutorial
7. More sounds
