# space-invaders
A C++ Space Invaders clone based on a tutorial by @educ8s. The base code was written as part of the tutorial and most of it has been refactored at this point - feel free to compare this repo to the tutorial repo (at the bottom of this readme).
<br>

## Additonal features implemented by me:
1. Start menu with keybindings (press i) and skip to random boss (press 1)
2. Pause button (ENTER) & pause music button (p)
3. Levels and infinite play
4. Boss battles every third level
5. Two different bosses - beat them for bonus lives!
6. Rising difficulty (max. reached after 10 levels)
7. Mostly refactored code for better structure
8. New AlienHandler, CollisionHandler, Highscore, UI classes
9. UI overhaul
10. Game states

## Possible future features:
1. More bosses
2. Power ups 
3. Ship upgrades between levels
4. Different player ship designs
5. More sounds

## How to compile with VSCode:
1. Install raylib (https://www.raylib.com/) to default path
2. Clone repo 
3. Start the main.code-workspace file
4. Press F5

You are on your own if you use another editor/IDE.
