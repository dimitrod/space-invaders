# space-invaders
A C++ Space Invaders clone based on a tutorial by @educ8s. Code was written as part of the tutorial, I didn't just clone the repo. ðŸ˜„
<br>

## Additonal features implemented by me:
1. Start "menu"
2. Pause button
3. Better "Game Over" screen
4. Game states
5. Separate UI class
6. Levels and infinite play
<br>

## How to compile:
1. Use VSCode
2. Pull repo
3. Start the main.code-workspace file
4. Press F5

You are on your own if you use another editor/IDE.
